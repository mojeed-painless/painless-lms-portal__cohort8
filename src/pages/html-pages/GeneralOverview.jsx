                       <p>
                        It’s often said that you don’t truly understand something until you can teach it 
                        to someone else. But I believe the real test of understanding is being able to teach it to a computer.

                       <p> 
                        <b>So, how exactly do you teach something to a computer?</b>
                        <i>How do you command a machine and feel that thrill when it obeys?</i>
                       </p>

                        <p>
                            Well, keep in mind—your computer doesn’t speak your native language.
                            It doesn’t understand English, French, or any human language.
                        </p>

                            <i><b>What is Computer Programming?</b></i>
                            At its core, computer programming is the process of writing a 
                            set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute.
                        </p>

                        <p>With computer programs, you can:</p>

                            <li>Build self-driving cars</li>
                            <li>Create immersive video games</li>
                            <li>Produce animated movies and graphics</li>
                            <li>Design powerful websites and mobile apps</li>
                            <li>And so much more</li>
                        </ul>
                            
                        <h3 className="bold">
                        In essence, programming is the language of creation in the 
                        digital world—and you're about to learn how to speak it.
